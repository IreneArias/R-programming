Description: This package will allow for easy Matrix operations necessary during dataset analysis in Bioinformatics.
    Some of the matrix operations that this package will include are: Inverse of a matrix, addition, substraction,
    and substition. The reasoning behind this package is that Bioinformaticians are in the constant need of generating
    matrices to represent data. This usually are represented through contact maps, heat maps along other types of matrix 
    vizualitation methods. The idea is to develop a package that will help to deal with matrices in an easier manner than 
    it is already currently done
