## Final Project Functions 
### These functions represent the main body of my package 

 For this project I will be generating functions that are capable of generating a contact matrix for a specific data set (repeceptor + ligand) and print the contacts based on a given cutoff distance (armstrongs). Another function will provide a contact or heat map.  Here is the definition  of my functions 
 
+ ContMat: ContMat (short for Contact Matrix) will provide the matrix for amino acid residues that are defined to be in contact based on a specific cutoff. 
+ ContMap: Provides a vizualization method for the previous function. It will provide a broader picture in order to vizualize the results as a heat map. 


A TestDataSet will be provided in the package.
